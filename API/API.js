He had a nice set up.. looked like a wood fire oven. Later in that day we decided to order a pizza with a few of his toppings. Kinda of pricey but let me tell you well worth the money. Great size pizza, fresh toppings and oh so delicious!! This to me was better than any papa johns or domino's. I ended up buying him a coffee. This dude was super cool and awesome. I would highly recommend his services",

I hear they have great cheesesteaks.  Maybe we can get those next time.  They came set up and fed over 100 people in like 2 hours.   Their crew was organized and on it!  Thank you boss and thank you DropOuts Pizza.",

Very light and tasty crust with fresh ingredients. We ordered a second one. Yeah, that good. Expect a nice small pie here. So you can order a few different ones. 5 stars.",

Very friendly service, showed up on time at our location, and got wood fired pizzas going right away. We will definitely use them again- without question. I usually do street tacos, but this was much more popular with my dealers. Thanks again Fredo!",
